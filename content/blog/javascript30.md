  I started Wes Bos's #JavaScript30 course. This is my take after the second
  day.

I am a full-time web applications developer at a top research university. I recently gained a “Senior” before my title. I have worked full time in this role for five years, with an additional four and a half years of part-time web development experience before that.

However, I feel woefully out of date when it comes to modern stacks. I lost my drive to keep up with new technologies some time ago, arguably as soon as I secured this job. Probably right around the time I wrote my last blog post. That’s why it feels appropriate to kick off this new phase with a blog post!

In my job, much of what I do is product or service maintenance. As long as things are running well and doing their jobs, there is little or no need to upgrade them to run using the latest technologies. There is also the concern of added “technical debt,” where the more languages our products are written in, the more work it might be to maintain them in the future. My unit has fairly low turnover and people like things the way they have been, or else they also suffer from lack of motivation to learn new tech. These things come together to discourage innovation and trying new things.

A new colleague of mine who recently graduated from a front-end development boot camp has brought with her a fresh perspective and fresh inspiration. I am ready to get back in the game of learning new things to build even cooler shit. This colleague recommended the free [\#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course as a refresher course for vanilla JS and it sounded like just the thing for me.

I just completed Day 2 and so far it has been great. Each day is a bite-sized chunk where you build something cool and surprisingly easy using only vanilla JavaScript without any frameworks or additional libraries. I wouldn’t recommend it for complete beginners, but if you know some JavaScript and want a refresher while learning some cool new ES6 tricks, you might want to check out this course.

I’ve made it my goal to work through at least one module per day during the workday, since this is totally valid and encouraged professional development. I’m on a two-day streak so far! I’m [tweeting every day](https://twitter.com/rleggos) after completing the day’s challenge to hold myself accountable. I’ve already learned a lot so far and I’m excited to see where the course goes from here and whether it helps me stay inspired.
